# Traffic Safety Dataset Research

This research project focuses on analyzing and understanding the dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The primary goal of this dataset is to facilitate the exchange of information related to traffic safety.

## Introduction

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is committed to addressing the significant human toll and property damage caused by motor vehicle traffic crashes in our society. Annually, these crashes lead to the loss of thousands of lives, leave hundreds of thousands injured, and result in billions of dollars in property damage. Accurate and comprehensive data are essential to support the development, implementation, and assessment of highway safety programs designed to reduce the impact of these incidents.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:** Conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset to understand the nature and distribution of the available information.

2. **Accident Analysis:** Investigate patterns and trends in traffic accidents, focusing on key factors such as severity, location, and driver conditions.

3. **Impact on Traffic Safety:** Evaluate the impact of the data on traffic safety and propose potential areas for improvement or approaches for more effective safety programs.

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis will be carried out using the R programming language and relevant libraries for data analysis and visualization.

## Repository Structure

- **notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks or R scripts used for data analysis.
- **datasets:** Stores the original dataset and any derived datasets.
- **results:** Includes visualizations and highlighted conclusions from the analysis.
